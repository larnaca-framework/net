# Larnaca ðŸŒ´ microservices framework

## Environment and building

This repository includes the setup for the [VSCode Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
Open it as a remote container and start hacking away.

## Overview

The framework is developer centric, and is designed to allow the developer to focus on the business logic abstracting away the DevOps stuff.
The vision is for the developer to write a class decorated with just a \[Microservice\] attribute, and allow the framework to generate all the code required to host this microservice.
